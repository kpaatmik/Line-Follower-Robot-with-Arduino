# Line-Follower-Robot-with-Arduino
This GitHub repository contains code, circuit design, and documentation for an Arduino Line Follower Robotâ€”a great project for beginners. The robot autonomously follows a path, typically a dark line on a contrasting surface, using infrared sensors, offering a hands-on experience with sensor integration and robotics principles.
